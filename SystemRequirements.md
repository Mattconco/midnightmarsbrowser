# System Requirements #

MMB2.0 requires Java 1.4 or later.

Unlike version 1.x, MMB2.0 does not require Java 3D, nor even want it.

Windows and Mac OS X are supported; those are the only platforms I can test on.

512 megs of RAM is the bare minimum required.

Huge amounts of hard drive space is required if you’re going to download many images.  We’re talking multiple gigabytes. The rovers have been going for a long time now; there are a lot of images. And that's the just normal JPEGs;  if you get into downloading the PDS IMG files, you'd better have a very large hard drive.

MMB2.0 is compatible with MMB1.x data, so you can go back and use features in MMB1.x - but don't run updates in both simultaneously or you will have image index corruption problems. Shut down one before using the other.
